Title: Email

I would love to hear from you but in order to email me, you'll have to construct my address from the instructions below. This is to prevent my address from being (further) harvested by spam bots. ~~Until the singularity, anyway.~~ Edit: I am aware that even very compact LLMs can complete the task below. So I'm sure that these days it's all for nought. Perhaps it's bad luck to be superstitious but I can't yet bring myself to put my email in plaintext on the open web.

My name is `charles` and my domain is `bityard` dot `net`. String those all together in the usual format and you'll be able to reach me. All will be read, eventually, but preference will be given to messages with excellent puns in them.
