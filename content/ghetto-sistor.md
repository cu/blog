This, my friends, is what is called a "ghetto-sistor."

It's what you get when you need a 1K ohm resistor, but don't have a new one handy, and instead have to settle for ripping one out of an old telephone before you realize that one leg is going to be too short so you solder a piece of solid scrap wire onto it so it's the right length.

Ghetto-sistor. GET IT?

Sheesh, you have no sense of humor.
